    <h1>Renderer Documentation</h1>
    <h2>High-level Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Jotun Engine ships with a deferred renderer which makes use of
      physically-based shading to achieve high-quality visuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The default renderer uses a number of passes:
    </p>
      <ol>
        <li>One depth-only pass for each shadow-casting light which produces a
          shadow map for that light. This pass uses frontface culling to cut
          down on shadow acne.</li>
        <li>A depth-only pass from the main camera's view. This pass uses
          backface culling to get the depth of the closesttriangles to the
          camera.</li>
        <li>A depth-only pass from the main camera's view. This pass uses
          frontface culling to get the thickness of the objects immediately
          visible to the camera.</li>
        <li>The gbuffer pass, which writes the material data of opaque materials
          to the gbuffer.</li>
        <li>One direct lighting pass per visible light, which calculates diffuse
          and specular lighting for that light. Lighting is accumulated in the
          lighting buffer.</li>
        <li>A Sub-Surface Scattering pass, which applies a 4x4 (probably) Gaussian
          box filter. The actual size of the filter varies with the data in the 
          SSS texture, to allow for objects that have a SSS radius which varies
          over the mesh. The SSS pass is executed in two steps, one for the
          vertical direction and one for the horozontal. Additionally, the box
          filter is oriented perpendicular to the current pixel's normal, and
          doesn't add in pixels which have too great of a depth difference (or
          maybe I'll use wrap lighitng? Seems less realistic).</li>
        <li>One reflection pass, which utilizes a screen-space reflections
          algorithm to generate reflected colors, combines those colors with the
          specular color, adds in the lighting data, and outputs to the composite
          buffer.<br/>
          NOTE: If additional reflection passes are desired (to simulate light
          bouncing multiple times), they are calculated before this pass.</li>
        <li>One refraction pass, which relies on the density of objects to 
          calculate refraction. However, rather than using raytracing like the 
          reflection pass, this pass draws all refractive objects using the depth
          of the current pixel before the depth of the refractive pixel is
          saved, using a simple right triangle to calculate the refracted pixel.
          Reflections are calculated again for this pass, using screen-space rays
          cast from each refractive pixel. Since the same algorithms and such
          are used in multiple passes, a competent shader build system will be
          developed (by zombies).</li>
        <li>Post-processing passes. The default renderer computes bloom, glare,
          vingette, film grain, and tonemapping.</li>
        <li>Anti-aliasing. The default renderer uses the SMAA algorithm, although
          the user can substitute any algorithm that operates on linear-space
          LDR data. Gamma correction is performed after this pass.</li>
      </ol>
    <h2>Depth-Only Passes</h2>
    <p>The depth-only passes are rendered first to avoid switching to the
      depth-only shader multiple times per frame. The depth-only passes output
      to either the depth buffer or a shadow map, depending on whether the
      shadow depth-only pass or the early-z depth-only pass is being
      rendered.</p>
    <h2>Gbuffer Pass</h2>
    <p>The gbuffer pass serves to write material data to the gbuffer. The
      material data is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Albedo (RGB)</li>
      <li>Specuar color (RGB) and roughness (A)</li>
      <li>Surface normal (RGB) in world space</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Tessellation</h3>
    <p>In this pass, the Jotun Engine's default renderer is able to calculate
      tessellation, providing a higher amount of tessellation where there are
      curves with a smaller radius in the normalmap. This is accomplished by
      running an edge-detection filter on the normalmap when it's mapped to its
      mesh and using the result of the edge-detection as an input to the
      tessellation control shader. Additionally, the Jotun Engine is able to
      tightly tessellate the mesh where multiple bones affect the mesh.</p>
    <h2>Direct Lighting</h2>
    <p>The direct lighting pass calculated diffuse and specular lighting from a
      given light source. One direct lighting pass is rendered for all the point
      and spot lights, and one direct lighting pass is rendered for each
      directional light. Point and spot lights use a geometry shader to generate
      a mesh which represents the screen-space area that each light covers.
      Spot lights generate a cone with a rounded bottom, where the rounded
      bottom is computed from an icosphere.</p>
    TODO: An image of the generated geometry.
    <p>Point lights use the same algorithm as spot lights, except they use a
      spot angle of 360 degrees, which produces a sphere.</p>
    TODO: An image of the generated geometry.
    <h3>Shadows</h3>
    <p>The fragment shader used on lights first determines the shadow strength
      of the current pixel. By default, the Jotun Engine has three shadow
      filtering options: Hard (no filtering), Soft (PCF), and Realistic (PCSS).
      Both the Soft and Realistic options use the light's size (defined
      per-light) to determine the softness of the shadows. Soft computes the
      softness when there's a one unit distance from the shadow caster to the
      shadow receiver</p>
    <p>The Jotun Engine allows the user to set a maximum number of
      shadow-casting lights, and to set lights as "important". Important lights
      will be considered for casting a shadow before unimportant lights. If
      there are more shadow-casting lights than the maximum allowed number, the
      Jotun Engine will determine which shadow-casting lights cover the most
      screen space (math formula based on light's size and distance from light
      to camera) and render the shadows which cover the most screen space.</p>
    <p>Math formula: area of circle (in world space) divided by distance from
      camera (to get screen-ish space).</p>
    <h3>Diffuse and Specular</h3>
    <p>Diffuse lighting is calculated using the Phong equations (cosine of angle
      between light vector and surface normal). Specular lighting is calculated
      with the Cook-Torance equation, where as many parameters as possible are
      calculated from the roughness. The diffuse and specular lighting are
      calculated without using the material's colors.</p>
    <h2>Reflections</h2>
    <p>The Jotun Engine utilizes a screen-space reflection algorithm to
      determine reflections and indirect lighting. The user is able to define
      the maximum number of ray steps allowed, as well as the distance per ray
      step. However, the Jotun Engine limits the length of a given ray to one
      pixel. If a ray is unable to be resolved, the Jotun Engine will take a
      color from the cubemap with the smallest area of effect.</p>
    <p>When a ray is cast from a given pixel, it is given a random offset from
      the pixel's normal with the random range increasing with the pixel's
      roughness. This results in rather grainy reflections. Although the
      anti-aliasing pass will help to alleviate this effect, the user is
      encouraged to increase the number of rays per pixel to achieve higher
      quality reflections.</p>
    <h2>Post-Processing</h2>
    <p>Since the Jotun Engine uses a HDR renderer by default, it applies a
      tonemapping operator before drawing to the screen. Therefore, there are
      two main post-processing modes: LDR and HDR. HDR effects are executed
      first. As many as possible as executed at the same time to reduce the
      number of draw calls. However, each post-processing effect is written as
      a single fragment shader, to increase code maintainability. All the
      fragment shaders are then combined into a single large shader when the
      project is built.</p>
    <p>Each effect can be executed before or after another effect. This causes
      the Jotun Engine to generate an extra rendering pass, so it is not
      recommended.</p>

    <h3>Writing a Post-Processing Effect</h3>
    <p>Post-processing effects have a number of variables available to them,
      including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The lighting buffer</li>
      <li>The reflection buffer</li>
      <li>The material properties buffer</li>
      <li>The composite buffer</li>
      <li>The transform of the camera</li>
      <li>Information about the render target: width and height</li>
    </ul>
